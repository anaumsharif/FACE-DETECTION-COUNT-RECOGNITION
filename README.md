## Face Detection and Count Recognition

This project focuses on implementing face detection and count recognition using Python and OpenCV. The goal is to detect faces in images or video streams and then count the number of faces present. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and examples.
The "Face Detection and Count Recognition" project is designed to detect faces within images or video streams using Python and the OpenCV library. This project provides a straightforward implementation of face detection algorithms, allowing users to identify faces and count the number of faces present in the provided input.

Key Components and Functionality:
Face Detection:
Utilizes OpenCV's built-in methods for face detection, such as Haar cascades or deep learning-based models (like DNN module with pre-trained models).
Processes input images or video frames to identify regions containing faces.
Face Count Recognition:
After detecting faces, the project accurately counts the number of faces present in the image or video.
Provides a reliable face count using robust face detection techniques.
### Features

- **Face Detection**:
  - Utilizes Haar cascades or deep learning-based methods to detect faces in images or video frames.
  - Can handle both static images and real-time video streams.

- **Face Count Recognition**:
  - Counts the number of faces detected in the input image or video.
  - Provides accurate face count results using efficient detection algorithms.

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

Install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Usage

1. **Clone Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/FACE-DETECTION-COUNT-RECOGNITION.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd face recognition
   ```

3. **Run Face Detection Script**:

   ```bash
   python face recognition.py --input input_image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `input_image.jpg` with the path to your input image or video.

### Scripts Overview

- **`face_detection.py`**:
  - Main script for face detection and count recognition.
  - Loads an input image or video file, detects faces, and displays the result with face count.

### Examples

#### 1. Face Detection in an Image

```bash
python fac recognitionn.py --input input_image.jpg
```

![Face Detection in Image](path/to/image_result.jpg)

#### 2. Face Detection in a Video

```bash
python face_detection.py --input input_video.mp4
```
